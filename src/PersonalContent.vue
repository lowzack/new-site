    <p>In my free time I enjoy playing and writing music. Ihave been playing music for most of my life
      and have been in multiple bands as a songwriter, trumpeter, bassist, and rhythm/lead guitarist. Currently I am
    working on honing in my songwriting and guitar playing, and attempting to push myself to higher levels of
  technical ability. In doing this I am also trying to branch out into different genres</p>
    <p>I also enjoy cooking and trying different foods. With this food affection, I also
    have an affection for craft beer, and attend many food and beer festivals in attempts to try as much as possible.</p>
    <p>Diehard Red Sox and Patriots fan, that's all I really need to say about that.</p>
